Finish Graphics manager

Create an Object Manager.

Create a shader manager

create a texture manager

encapsulate camera system

make textures load textures from json file

make object loader create objects from json file while
accessing shaders and textures from both managers.

make input manager

So far:
Objects have somewhat been added, they need a draw() function.

Object manager requires a way to get certain shaders and textures from the other managers.
