Finish Graphics manager

Create an Object Manager.

Create a shader manager

Setup texture object
create a texture manager

encapsulate camera system

make input manager

make textures load textures from json file

make object loader create objects from json file while
accessing shaders and textures from both managers.

Make a get time function for graphics manager

setup wireframe system
Move input part of graphics manager to input manager.



So far:
Objects have somewhat been added, they need a draw() function.

Object manager requires a way to get certain shaders and textures from the other managers.
